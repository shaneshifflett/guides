    "The Federal Election Commission was created to regulate campaign finance law. They produce reports and data disclosing contributions to **campaign committees** representing candidates running for federal office. This means you can find data for Senate, House of Representatives and Presidential campaigns. You can find other sites, like the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/), that have parsed FEC data to create tools and searchable databases focused on important topics such as political spendin by organization and industry. You can use the FEC's online tool to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find a summary of a candidate's spending and fund raising\n",
    "* Easily locate expenses and disburesments and refunds\n",
    "* Identify contributions made by individuals\n",
    "* View party committees contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more exhaustive data sets available requiring a deep understanding cross-table lookups and filing definitions. We'll stick to the reports generated by the FEC using the candidate search tool.\n",

    "When you search for a candidate you will may be presented with a candidate's campaign committee from other elections.\n",

    ">  A committee could be a candidate’s principal campaign committee, a\n",

    "> Candidates for political office also receive an ID number from the FEC. These IDs are similar to\n",
    "committee IDs but are prefixed with P, H or S (rather than C) depending on whether the person is a\n",
    "candidate for president, the House or the Senate. The FEC assigns multiple IDs to candidates who run\n",
