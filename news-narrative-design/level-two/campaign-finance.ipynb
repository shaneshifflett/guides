    "# Covering Campaign Finance: An Intro\n",

    "\n",
    "The Federal Election Commission was created to regulate campaign finance law. They produce reports and data disclosing contributions to **campaign committees** representing candidates running for federal office. This means you can find data for Senate, House of Representatives and Presidential campaigns. You can find other sites, like the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/), that have parsed FEC data to create tools and searchable databases focused on important topics such as political spendin by organization and industry. You can use the FEC's online tool to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find a summary of a candidate's spending and fund raising\n",
    "* Easily locate expenses and disburesments and refunds\n",
    "* Identify contributions made by individuals\n",
    "* View party committees contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more exhaustive data sets available requiring a deep understanding cross-table lookups and filing definitions. We'll stick to the reports generated by the FEC using the candidate search tool. You should also read the [Citizen's Guide](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/citizens.shtml) describing what is tracked and what is not. For example, it describes contribution limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Contribution Limits\n",
    "> An individual may give a maximum of:\n",
    " * \\$2,700 per election to a Federal candidate or the candidate's campaign committee.2 Notice that the limit applies separately to each election. Primaries, runoffs and general elections are considered separate elections.\n",
    " * \\$5,000 per calendar year to a PAC. This limit applies to a PAC (political action committee) that supports Federal candidates. (PACs are neither party committees nor candidate committees. Some PACs are sponsored by corporations and unions--trade, industry and labor PACs. Other PACs, often ideological, do not have a corporate or labor sponsor and are therefore called nonconnected PACs.) PACs use your contributions to make their own contributions to Federal candidates and to fund other election-related activities.\n",
    " * \\$10,000 per calendar year to a State or local party committee. A State party committee shares its limits with local party committees in that state unless a local committee's independence can be demonstrated.\n",
    " * \\$33,400 per calendar year to a national party committee. This limit applies separately to a party's national committee, House campaign committee and Senate campaign committee.\n",
    " * \\$100 in currency (cash) to any political committee. (Anonymous cash contributions may not exceed \\$50.) Contributions exceeding \\$100 must be made by check, money order or other written instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you search for a candidate you will may be presented with a candidate's campaign committee from other elections.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  A committee could be a candidate’s principal campaign committee, a\n",
    "legislator’s leadership political action committee (PAC) or joint fundraising committee, a PAC for a\n",
    "corporation or union, or an independent expenditure only committee (sometimes referred to as a Super\n",
    "PAC). \n",

    "\n",
    "> Candidates for political office also receive an ID number from the FEC. These IDs are similar to\n",
    "committee IDs but are prefixed with P, H or S (rather than C) depending on whether the person is a\n",
    "candidate for president, the House or the Senate. The FEC assigns multiple IDs to candidates who run\n",
    "for more than one office\n",

    "You can download individual contributions by clicking \"Itemized Individual Contributions\" and clicking \"Export CSV\"\n",

    "Reports are generated based on filing deadlines which are generally monthly and quarterly. [Link to deadline information](http://www.fec.gov/info/report_dates_2016.shtml). This also does not cover Super-PACs. Use [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00000019) for more exhaustive inclusion of a candidate's entire fund-raising operation.\n",

    " * Trump nearly quintupled rent for his campaign HQ at Trump Towers in Manhattan after taking donations\n",

    " > The FEC filings show that Trump began increasing the rent at Trump Tower starting with the May 31 payment of \\$72,800. The Trump campaign paid \\$110,684 in rent on June 9, and \\$169,758 on July 10.\n",

    "#### How To Locate Campaign Expenses\n",
    "\n",
    "After locating Trump's presidental campaign committee and downloading his campaign's expenses, let's check to make sure we're seeing the same data as The Huffington Post did when writing about the amount of rent his business charges his campaign.\n",
